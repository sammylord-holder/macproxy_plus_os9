### Extensions

Each extension has its own folder within the `extensions` directory. Extensions can be individually enabled or disabled via a `config.py` file in the root directory.

To enable extensions:

1. In the root directory, rename ```config.py.example``` to ```config.py``` :

	```shell
	mv config.py.example config.py
	```

2. In ```config.py```, enable/disable extensions by uncommenting/commenting lines in the ```ENABLED_EXTENSIONS``` list:

	```python
	ENABLED_EXTENSIONS = [
		#disabled_extension,
		"enabled_extension"
		]
	```

### Starting MacProxy Plus

On Unix-like systems (such as Linux or macOS), run the ```start_macproxy.sh``` script. It will create a Python virtual environment, install the required Python packages, and make the proxy server available on your local network.

```shell
./start_macproxy.sh
```

On Windows, run the analogous PowerShell script, ```start_macproxy.ps1```:

```powershell
.\start_macproxy.ps1
```

### Connecting to MacProxy Plus from your Vintage Machine
To use MacProxy Plus, you'll need to configure your vintage browser or operating system to connect to the proxy server running on your host machine. The specific steps will vary depending on your browser and OS, but if your system lets you set a proxy server, it should work.

If you're using a BlueSCSI to get a vintage Mac online, <a href="https://bluescsi.com/docs/WiFi-DaynaPORT">this guide</a> should help with the initial Internet setup.

### Example Extension: ChatGPT

A ChatGPT extension is provided as an example. This extension serves a simple web interface that lets users interact with OpenAI's GPT models.

To enable the ChatGPT extension, open ```config.py```, uncomment the ```chatgpt``` line in the ```ENABLED_EXTENSIONS``` list, and replace ```YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE``` with your actual OpenAI API key.

```python
open_ai_api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"

ENABLED_EXTENSIONS = [
	"chatgpt"
]
```

Once enabled, Macproxy will reroute requests to ```http://chatgpt.com``` to this inteface.
